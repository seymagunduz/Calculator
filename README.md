# Calculator App
## About This Project
This project is a simple calculator application developed using Android Studio. It was created as part of my learning journey to gain hands-on experience with Android app development. Throughout the development process, I acquired valuable skills in various areas, including:

* Android Studio Usage: I learned how to navigate and utilize Android Studio, Google's official IDE for Android development. This included setting up the development environment, using the design and code editors, and debugging the application.

* Basic XML Layouts: I gained experience in writing and managing XML layouts for Android applications. This project involved creating user interfaces with XML, understanding different layout types, and organizing UI components effectively.

* Kotlin Programming Language: I developed the application using Kotlin, which is the preferred language for Android development. This allowed me to learn Kotlin syntax, object-oriented programming principles, and how to interact with Android's APIs using Kotlin.

* Layout Management: I explored various layout options such as ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout to design a user-friendly and responsive calculator interface. This experience helped me understand how to arrange UI elements and ensure proper alignment and spacing.
